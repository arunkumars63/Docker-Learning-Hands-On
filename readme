Docker is a tool (platform) used to create, package, and run applications in a lightweight, portable unit called a container.

A container includes:
✅ your app
✅ libraries & dependencies
✅ configuration needed to run

Docker Fundamentals (Core Concepts)

1) Container
A container is a running instance of an image.
Fast to start
Uses less memory than Virtual Machines (VMs)
Shares the host OS kernel

📌 Example: Running a Python API inside a container.

2) Image
A Docker image is like a template / blueprint used to create containers.
Read-only
Built using a Dockerfile

📌 Example: An image with Nginx + your website files.

3) Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a script that tells Docker how to build an image.
Example steps inside Dockerfile:
Choose base OS (Ubuntu, Alpine, Node, etc.)
Copy app files
Install dependencies
Run your app

4) Docker Engine
The Docker Engine is the main service that runs Docker.
It manages:
building images
running containers
networking & storage

5) Docker Registry (Docker Hub)
A registry is where Docker images are stored.
Docker Hub is the most popular public registry
Private registries exist for companies

📌 Example: docker pull nginx

6) Volumes (Storage)
Containers are temporary. If a container is deleted, data may be lost.
So we use volumes to store data permanently.

✅ Used for: DB storage, logs, uploads.

7) Networking
Docker provides networks to allow containers to talk to each other.
Common types:
bridge (default)
host
none

📌 Example: Your app container talks to MySQL container.

8) Docker Compose (Multi-container apps)
Docker Compose helps run multiple services using one file: docker-compose.yml

✅ Example stack:
frontend
backend API
database

Docker vs Virtual Machine (Quick)

Feature	             Docker Container	            Virtual Machine
Boot time	              Seconds	                   Minutes
Uses OS	              Shares Host OS	             Own full OS
Size	                Small (MBs)	                 Large (GBs)
Performance	          Faster	                     Slower
